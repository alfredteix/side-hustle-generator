Side Hustle Generator
The Side Hustle Generator is an interactive web tool designed to help users discover ideal side hustle opportunities tailored to their unique skills, goals, and resources. The generator collects user input—including primary goals (extra income, learning a new skill, building a business, or pursuing passion), main skills (such as writing, coding, design, teaching, athletics, sales, or marketing), skill level, available hours per week, and available capital—and dynamically generates personalized side hustle suggestions. The results are displayed in a responsive modal popup for a seamless experience across PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a responsive design and a clear, modern user interface. It also integrates a centered Fiverr banner (affiliate link) at the top, adding an additional monetization element. Whether you're just starting out or looking to explore new income opportunities, the Side Hustle Generator offers practical insights and inspiration to kickstart your entrepreneurial journey.
